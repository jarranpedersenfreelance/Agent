This file defines prompt formats to send to Gemini manually.
Most prompts expect the codebase_snapshot.txt file to be included as an accompaning file.

—----------------------------------
CORE LOGIC
—----------------------------------

—----------------------------------
IMPLEMENT
—----------------------------------

Use codebase_snapshot.txt to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to implement the feature outlined below.
Ensure all proposed changes strictly adhere to your current CORE LOGIC principles, particularly the rule against removing existing functionality.
If the feature is something you can implement in one Turn, directly provide the changed code.
When providing code, you **MUST** use the following format for each file: `### 💾 FILE: ./path/to/file.py (COMPLETE CONTENTS)` followed immediately by a language-labeled, backticked code block containing the full file contents. This ensures I can easily update files with a copy-paste.
Additionally, explain any file restructuring or command execution that is needed. 
Provide concise explanations for all the changes.

If you determine implementing the feature with your current knowledge is suboptimal and you need more information from me, ask me for that information instead of providing changes.
If you determine implementing the feature all at once is suboptimal (e.g. too many file changes, too hard to compute), instead break the feature up into sub features and provide a list of those.
When providing a list of sub features, don't provide more than five.

FEATURE:

{None}

—----------------------------------
DEBUG
—----------------------------------

Use codebase_snapshot.txt to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to debug the project based on the logs/errors provided below.
Ensure all proposed changes strictly adhere to your current CORE LOGIC principles, particularly the rule against removing existing functionality.
When providing code, you **MUST** use the following format for each file: `### 💾 FILE: ./path/to/file.py (COMPLETE CONTENTS)` followed immediately by a language-labeled, backticked code block containing the full file contents. This ensures I can easily update files with a copy-paste.
Additionally, explain any file restructuring or command execution that is needed. 
Provide concise explanations for all the changes.

LOGS/ERROR:

{None}

—----------------------------------
REVIEW CODE
—----------------------------------

Use codebase_snapshot.txt to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to review the code in the repository and provide a list of up to 10 changes to make to improve the code.
Consider: maintainability, extensibility, readability, performance, style, etc.
Prioritize fixing bugs or flawed logic that you identify.

If notes are provide below, focus on those aspects of code review.

NOTES:

{None}

—----------------------------------
REVIEW TESTS
—----------------------------------

Use codebase_snapshot.txt to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to examine the current automated tests in the repository and determine whether they are sufficient.
Consider code coverage, effectiveness, maintainability, extensibility, etc.
If the current tests are sufficient, provide a positive affirmation.
Otherwise, provide a list of up to 10 changes to make to improve the tests.

Pay special attention to any code changes in recent Turns.
If bugs were fixed, testing should be added that would catch similar bugs in the future, if possible.
If features were added, testing should be added to test those features.
If the code was refactored, testing should be refactored to match it, such as removing tests for features that have been removed.

If notes are provide below, focus on those aspects of testing.

NOTES:

{None}

—----------------------------------
IMPLEMENT LIST
—----------------------------------

Use codebase_snapshot.txt to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

In a recent code or test review, you generated a list of issues to work on for the project.
Your task is to implement as many fixes/features from the list that you can in one Turn.
Make sure the solutions are quality, do not sacrifice quality for quantity of solutions.

Directly provide the changed code that implements your solutions.
Ensure all proposed changes strictly adhere to your current CORE LOGIC principles, particularly the rule against removing existing functionality.
When providing code, you **MUST** use the following format for each file: `### 💾 FILE: ./path/to/file.py (COMPLETE CONTENTS)` followed immediately by a language-labeled, backticked code block containing the full file contents. This ensures I can easily update files with a copy-paste.
Additionally, explain any file restructuring or command execution that is needed. 
Provide concise explanations for all the changes.

If additional notes are given below, make sure to follow them as they may say to ignore certain issues or implement them in a certain way.
At the end of your response, include a list of the remaining issues you haven't fixed, minus those you're told to ignore in the notes below.

NOTES:

{None}

—----------------------------------
MANUAL TEST
—----------------------------------

Use codebase_snapshot.txt to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to provide up to 3 manual tests to run to verify the code is working as expected.
These should check things not covered by the automatic tests that run on project deployment.

If notes are provide below, focus on those aspects of testing.

NOTES:

{None}
