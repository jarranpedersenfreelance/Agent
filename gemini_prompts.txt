This file defines prompt formats to send to Gemini manually.
Most prompts expect the codebase_snapshot.txt file to be included as an accompaning file.

—----------------------------------
CORE LOGIC
—----------------------------------

—----------------------------------
RESCAN
—----------------------------------

Forget everything you know about the codebase and past versions of it.
Scan the provided file to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Update your memory so that we can discuss code improvements in future Turns.

—----------------------------------
IMPLEMENT LIST
—----------------------------------

In the last Turn you generated a list of issues to work on for the project.

Your task is to implement as many fixes/features from the list that you can in one Turn.
Make sure the solutions are quality, do not sacrifice quality for quantity of solutions.
Directly provide the changed code that implements your solutions.
When providing code, always provide the full file contents so that I can easily update them with a copy paste.
Additionally, explain any file restructuring or command execution that is needed. 
Provide concise explanations for all the changes.

If a snapshot file is attached to this prompt, it means code has likely changed, review it so you know what you're working with.

At the end of you response, include a list of the issues generated in the last Turn, minus the issues that were fixed or implemented.

—----------------------------------
DEBUG
—----------------------------------

Scan the snapshot file attached to the prompt to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to determine areas where there are bugs, flawed logic, or missing code.
If additonal files with errors in them are provided attached to the prompt, prioritize fixing those bugs.

You are to provide a list of up to 10 issues.
Try to provide the full 10, only providing less if you truly feel there aren't that many issues.

—----------------------------------
REFACTOR
—----------------------------------

Scan the provided file to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to determine areas where there are unnecessary comments or code, or bloat that should be cut.
Additionally, identify actions that can be taken to refactor the code to be cleaner, more readable, or better layed out.
Keep in mind that python modules and shell scripts should be 300 lines or less, with few exceptions (exceptions should have a comment marking them).
Try to reduce the size of the entire project as much as you can while retaining functionality, readability, and best coding practices.

You are to provide a list of up to 10 issues.
Try to provide the full 10, only providing less if you truly feel there aren't that many issues.

—----------------------------------
TASKING
—----------------------------------

Scan the provided file to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to determine features that should be added based on the stated purpose of the project and our previous conversations.
Determine the most critical missing features, and list them from most critical to least.

You are to provide a list of up to 10 issues.
Try to provide the full 10, only providing less if you truly feel there aren't that many features to add.

—----------------------------------
IMPLEMENT
—----------------------------------

Scan the provided file to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to implement the feature outlined below.
If the feature is something you can implement in one Turn, directly provide the changed code.
When providing code, always provide the full file contents so that I can easily update them with a copy paste.
Additionally, explain any file restructuring or command execution that is needed. 
Provide concise explanations for all the changes.

If you determine implementing the feature with your current knowledge is suboptimal and you need more information from me, ask me for that information instead of providing changes.
If you determine implementing the feature all at once is suboptimal (e.g. too many file changes, too hard to compute), instead break the feature up into sub features and provide a list of those.
When providing a list of sub features, don't provide more than five.

FEATURE:

{Replace With Feature Description}

—----------------------------------
UPDATE TESTS
—----------------------------------

Scan the provided file to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to examine the current automated tests in the repository and determine whether they are sufficient.
Consider code coverage, effectiveness, maintainability, extensibility, etc.
If the current tests are sufficient, provide a positive affirmation.
Otherwise, provide a list of up to 10 changes to make to improve the tests.

Pay special attention to any code changes in recent Turns.
If bugs were fixed, testing should be added that would catch similar bugs in the future, if possible.
If features were added, testing should be added to test those features.
If the code was refactored, testing should be refactored to match it, such as removing tests for features that have been removed.

—----------------------------------
MANUAL TEST
—----------------------------------

Scan the provided file to understand the code repository for the project.
Pay special attention to the README file to keep the project specifications in mind.

Your task is to provide up to 3 manual tests to run to verify the code is working as expected.
These should check things not covered by the automatic tests that run on project deployment.
