ACTION SYNTAX
=============

An action is a single-line command output by the Agent's reasoning step.
The action must adhere to one of the following formats:

1. READ_FILE: <filename>
   - Reads and returns the content of the specified file.
   - Example: READ_FILE: src/core/agent_core.py

2. WRITE_FILE: <filename> <content>
   - Writes the specified content to the file. Overwrites existing content.
   - Example: WRITE_FILE: src/new_script.py #!/usr/bin/env python\nprint("Hello")

3. SLUMBER: [seconds]
   - FIX #5: Puts the agent to sleep for a specified number of seconds (float).
   - If no seconds are specified, a default, short sleep is performed.
   - Example: SLUMBER: 3600 # Sleep for one hour
   - Example: SLUMBER: 0.5 # Sleep for half a second

4. CREATE_DEBUG_SNAPSHOT: [filename.zip]
   - FIX #8, #9: Creates a zip file containing the contents of the 'data/' folder and key state files.
   - If no filename is provided, a timestamped file is used.
   - Example: CREATE_DEBUG_SNAPSHOT: post_refactor_state.zip
