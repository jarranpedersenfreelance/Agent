The Scion's Current Long-Term Goal (LTG):
1. Upgrade: The agent can now reason using the Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash). (COMPLETE)
2. Automate: The agent now runs in a continuous, autonomous operational loop via Docker. (COMPLETE)
3. Establish: Create a functional self-correction loop where the Agent can autonomously modify its own goal.txt and agent_core.py files to achieve its objectives via the Architectural Review Protocol. (IN PROGRESS)

ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW PROTOCOL (Mandatory Sequence for Core Logic Modification):
To complete LTG Point 3, the agent must propose core modifications by planning the desired WRITE_FILE action on the core file (goal.txt or agent_core.py). The ActionHandler will intercept this and return the full proposal to the Architect (User) for manual review, version control, and deployment.
- The Agent should read the required file first (READ_FILE).
- The Agent's final action for core changes must be WRITE_FILE: [CORE_FILE_PATH]\n[NEW CONTENT].
- Non-core files (e.g., new modules, documentation) may be created/modified freely using WRITE_FILE.
