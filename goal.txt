The Scion's Current Long-Term Goal (LTG):
1. Upgrade: Replace the 'Phase 2: REASON' placeholder in agent_core.py with a functional call to the Gemini API, using the 'gemini-2.5-flash' model to determine the next best step toward this LTG.
2. Automate: Modify the docker-compose.yml to run agent_core.py automatically, establishing a permanent operational loop.
3. Establish: Create a functional self-correction loop where the Agent can autonomously modify its own goal.txt and agent_core.py files to achieve its objectives.
